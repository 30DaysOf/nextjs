title: Roadmap

I kickstarted this learning journey on `October 16, 2022`!

## Objectives

 - **Refresh React.js knowledge** - v18 usage, design patterns, popular integrations.
 - **Acquire Next.js experience** - learn core features and value proposition of server-side framework
 - **Build/Deploy Full Stack Apps** - involving one or more of the following service integrations:
    - Strapi - as CMS
    - Stripe - as Payment Provider
    - Material UI - as Components library
    - Azure Static Web Apps - as Application Host
    - Azure Functions - for Serverless API
    - Azure Cosmos DB - for Serverless Database 
    - MongoDB Atlas - for Serverless Database
    - Playwright - as End-to-End testing harness
    - GitHub Actions - for automated build/deploy

## Plan 
Over the next #30Days I plan to explore various aspects of these three goals in some code-driven fashion, typically by deconstructing or replicating known tutorials and quickstarts to get familiar with best practices.

At the end of that journey, I will restructure my writings into a more usable roadmap for a 4-week learning journey:
 - **Core Concepts** (React & Next.js Fundamentals)
 - **Front-End Development** (React UI & Playwright Testing)
 - **Back-End Development** (Next.js & Cloud Integrations)
 - **Full-Stack App Walkthrough** (Develop or Deconstruct a real-world app)

## Progress 
Until then, follow my journey through a series of regular [Today I Learned](/til/intro) posts.
