# Template for #30Days Projects

I started the #30Days series as a way to create structured learning roadmaps to help anyone explore a new technology or topic over the span of one month. The goal was to break down the topic into 4 themed weeks, then break down each theme into 7 posts (one per day) that would help you progress incrementally from learning core concepts to building solutions and adopting best practices.

However, I realized this was a good way to plan and execute _any_ month-long project. Some examples:
 - Pick a new technology and learn it in 30 days
 - Build an application from scratch in 30 days
 - Deconstruct, then extend, an open-source project in 30 days
 - Identify 30 tips or tricks for productive use of a tool or framework

This template is meant to make it easier to plan and document your #30Day learning journey with a GitHub-Pages hosted website.
